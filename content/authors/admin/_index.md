Hi there! I am Isaiah, an AI researcher and data scientist living in Brooklyn, NY working at Peraton Labs. I am passionate about harnessing AI and big data to solve bigger problems in society. This site is mainly a collection of my work and a place to store ongoing thoughts. Feel free to reach out if anything piques your interest!


In my free time I am probably reading up on the latest NBA trade rumor or trying a new restaurant.
