The goal of the project is to generate Shakespearean sonnets based on 5 keywords given to the model. Shakespearean sonnets have a specific meter and rhyme scheme that hopefully our model will learn to generate, and we will evaluate our generated sonnets based on their adherence to this structure and their similarity to the keywords provided as input.
